                <p class="featured2details">Knowing what is going on in the world is vital to your work as an architect. Try to keep track of the latest projects, the emerging architects and practices, the new competitions, and the award winners.</p>
                <div class="featured2info">
                    <div class="featured2description"> <b style="color: black;"> Remind yourself how much you have to learn</b> <br>  <br> The first step in learning something is recognizing that you don’t know it. That sounds obvious, but experienced programmers remember how long it took to overcome this personal assumption.</div>
                    <div class="featured2description"> <b style="color: black;"> Stop trying to prove yourself right</b> <br> <br>To become great—not just good—you have to learn from experience. But be careful, experience can teach us to repeat poor behavior and to create bad habits. We’ve all encountered programmers with eight years of experience ... the same year of experience, repeated eight times.  </div>
                    <div class="featured2description"> <b style="color: black;">“The code works” isn’t where you stop; it’s where you start</b> <br> <br>Yes, your first step is always to write quality software that fulfills the spec. Average programmers quit at that point and move on to the next thing. </div>
                    <div class="featured2description"> <b style="color: black;">Write it three times</b> <br> <br> This level of work may not be obvious when you look at the work of the best developers. Everything they do seems so brilliant, but what you don’t see is that even rock-star developers probably threw out the first and second versions before showing their software to anyone else. Throwing away code and starting over can be a powerful way to include “make it better” into your personal workflow.</div>
